#TO-DO-TWO: The SQL

This is just a simple todo app for the terminal. It uses a PostgresSQL database running locally on port 5432 and operates under a user named 'todo' with password 'todopassword'. The app assumes you have a table already created named 'todos'. Grant user todo necessary permissions to read, write, update and delete to this table.
